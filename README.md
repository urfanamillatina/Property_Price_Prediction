Modelling Machine Learning for House Sales Price Prediction

Machine learning models which predict house price fall into regression model, supervised learning category. Supervised learning aims to detect the relationships between independent features (variables) and a target feature (dependent variable). In this case, the target feature is the Sales price of a house, and the remaining features are independent variables. These variables can be found in the data fields of the dataset: train.csv and test.csv files acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course/data

This machine learning applies three algorithms: 
1. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
2. Random Forest
3. eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost).

Performance metrics: 
1. RMSE
2. R-Squared
3. MAE
4. MSE

Steps in modelling machine learning for house sales price prediction:
1. Getting ready
2. Data Collection
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Pre-Processing
5. Modelling and Evaluations
